CVE-2018-14847 

MikroTik RouterOS through 6.42 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to read arbitrary files and remote authenticated attackers to write arbitrary files due to a directory traversal vulnerability in the WinBox interface.

When I looking the some of the compromised miktorik routers I found coin-hive site key than I try to find more details about compromised miktorik devices.

coin-hive site key: "oiKAGEslcNfjfgxTMrxKGMJvh436ypIM" you can find more cryptojacking-malware with using osint techniques
